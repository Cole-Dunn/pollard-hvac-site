Your Goal: To create the missing Decap CMS admin files that were missed in the initial build.

Instructions for the AI:
You missed a step in the initial project setup. I need you to create the admin panel files now. Do not alter any other existing files.

1. Create the admin Folder:

In the project's root directory, create a new folder named admin.

2. Create the admin/config.yml File:

Inside the new admin folder, create a file named config.yml.

Paste the following code exactly as it is into that file:

YAML

backend:
  name: github
  repo: your-github-username/your-repo-name # IMPORTANT: Placeholder
  branch: main

media_folder: "static/images/uploads"
public_folder: "/static/images/uploads"

collections:
  - name: "pages"
    label: "Page Content"
    files:
      - label: "Homepage"
        name: "home"
        file: "_data/content.json"
        fields:
          - { label: "Main Headline", name: "main_headline", widget: "string" }
          - { label: "About Us Text", name: "about_us_text", widget: "text" }
          - label: "Core Services"
            name: "core_services"
            widget: "list"
            fields:
              - { label: "Service Name", name: "name", widget: "string" }
              - { label: "Service Description", name: "description", widget: "text" }
          - label: "Why Choose Us Points"
            name: "why_choose_us_points"
            widget: "list"
            fields:
              - { label: "Point", name: "point", widget: "string" }
          - label: "Reviews"
            name: "reviews"
            widget: "list"
            fields:
              - { label: "Quote", name: "quote", widget: "text" }
              - { label: "Customer Name", name: "customer_name", widget: "string" }
              - { label: "Rating (1-5)", name: "rating", widget: "number" }
          - { label: "Contact Phone", name: "contact_phone", widget: "string" }
          - { label: "Contact Address", name: "contact_address", widget: "string" }
3. Create the admin/index.html File:

Inside the admin folder, create another file named index.html.

Paste the following code exactly as it is into that file:

HTML

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Content Manager</title>
  <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@^3.0.0/dist/decap-cms.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
