Hello! Please create a clean, mobile-friendly, and fully client-editable website for a local HVAC business.

The final product must be built on a robust framework using Decap CMS to manage all content. All instructions, especially the file path rules, must be followed precisely.

Part 1: Core Business & Design Specifications
Business Name: Pollard Heating & Cooling

Location: West Lorne, Ontario

Contact Info:

Phone: 519-768-2800

Address: 10182 Graham Road (RR 2), West Lorne, ON N0L 2P0

Logo: Create a simple SVG icon placeholder featuring a red flame next to a blue snowflake, followed by the business name.

Design Guidelines:

Use a professional red and blue color scheme.

Use clean, clear fonts like Open Sans with large, readable text.

The layout must be fully responsive and built using Bootstrap 5.

Include a sticky navigation bar and a footer with contact info and a copyright notice for the current year.

Part 2: Technical Framework (Strict Instructions)
2A. File Path & Linking Rules:

All custom CSS files must be placed in the /static/css/ directory.

In index.html, the link to the main stylesheet must be exactly <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/style.css">.

All custom JavaScript files must be placed in the /static/js/ directory.

In index.html, the script tag must be exactly <script src="/static/js/main.js"></script>.

All user-uploaded images from the CMS must be configured to save to /static/images/uploads/.

2B. Project Structure:
Based on the rules above, create this exact structure:

index.html

admin/ (containing index.html and config.yml)

_data/ (leave empty)

static/

css/ (containing style.css)

js/ (containing main.js)

images/uploads/ (leave empty)

2C. CMS Configuration (admin/config.yml):
Configure Decap CMS with a GitHub backend (use a placeholder for the repo URL). The editable fields must include:

A text block for about_us_text.

A list widget for core_services (with name and description).

A list widget for why_choose_us_points (with a single point text field).

A list widget for reviews (with quote, customer_name, and rating number fields).

A list widget for navigation_links (with text and url fields).

A string for contact_phone.

A string for contact_address.

2D. Website Skeleton & Logic:

index.html: Create the HTML skeleton. It must link to Bootstrap 5 CSS and use the strictly defined paths for local CSS/JS. It must contain empty container elements with IDs matching the CMS fields (e.g., <div id="about-us-container"></div>, <div id="services-container"></div>, <div id="reviews-container"></div>, etc.).

admin/index.html: Add the standard code to load and run Decap CMS.

static/js/main.js: Write the JavaScript to fetch /_data/content.json and dynamically populate all corresponding container IDs in the HTML.

Part 3: Initial Website Content
Use the following information as the default content for the editable fields. The JavaScript should render this content on the initial page load.
